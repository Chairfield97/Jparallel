# Summer Science Institute 
# This summer project aims to make mulithtreaded programming in Java easier to accomplish. To achieve this, it will utilize the ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) parser generator. 
# With ANTLR, we can define atomic portions of code known as "tokens" and the rules in which they can be typed out with context to one another. 
# With this, we should be able to add a new token keyword "parallel" along with the already defined curly brace tokens "{}" to create a new block type in Java.
# Every statement within this block will then be ran in parallel which will require the tool to create a thread class and override the run method within the class for each statement.
